A [git scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) that records Guido Fawkes listing of declared Conservative nominations for leadership candidates.

Exports the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PRufWhh2YAoxPUJEXeVaEOe7rcT1IINOXijeLI6o9Cc/htmlview?pru=AAABhBtpQ1w) as CSV every 5 minutes, so changes are visible.

Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw/)'s [Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival scraper](https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hmb-traffic).
